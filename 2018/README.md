# 2018 Birmingham Technologists Salary Survey

This was the first year of the salary survey.

## Overview

* We had **79** people take part.
    * It was not as many as I had hoped for, but still good enough for a first try.
* Respondents were entirely self-selecting.
    * Anyone who thought they counted as a "technologist" and lived within Birmingham were invited to take part.
    * We asked those who earned the majority of their income through freelance work did not fill out the survey.
* The questions were put together from discussions amongst the Slack group.
    * None of whom (as far as I'm aware) are social scientists in any way. *That includes me.*
* Respondents were guaranteed anonymity. All data is anonymised and is not traceable back to the owner.
* I spent **£75** on Facebook ads targeted at software engineers in Birmingham. This was expensive and probably only brought in 10 or so responses.

#### Overview of findings

* Range of salaries recorded were between **£18,000 - £120,000**
